Hello! My name is Emily I and I have always been an avid learner regarding sci fi! I love playing the violin and hope to continue playing for the rest of my life! I also speak 2 languages fluently and I am very much a beginner at 4 others! I pride myself on my ability to help others recognize their potential as well as just generally help others! I joined astroventure as I recognized that I could grow my love of Sci-fi and bring astrophysics into the equation! As I am in this group I will most definitely be providing some insights into the scientific backgrounds and explanation of some scifi movies and ideas! If you need to contact me my Instagram handle is @yatokgami !

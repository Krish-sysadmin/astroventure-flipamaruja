                the existence of life, Venus would undoubtedly rank somewhere at the bottom. Its high
                temperature, extremely dense atmosphere filled with thick Sulfuric Acid gas clouds and roaring
                volcanoes that continuously contribute to Venus’s GreenHouse Effect is a hell when compared to
                life probable sites like Mars, Saturn’s moon Titan and others. Despite this fact, the recent
                discovery of Phosphine (PH3) may well position Venus right at the top. In this article we’ll see
                how the discovery of a single compound at its atmosphere might be such a strong proof after all.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12">
               <p class="Phosphoine-p-2">Before diving into the subtle proof, let's talk a bit about Venus. Venus is the 3rd brightest object in
                the sky after the Sun and the moon. It hangs around the sun just before sunset and sunrise. It has
                a diameter 90 percent of Earth’s and is even inside the Goldilocks Zone: The Zone capable of
                harboring liquid water. Despite these similarities, Venus has long been thought to be one of the
                least favorable places for harboring life. Its atmosphere undergoes something that is known as
                the runaway GreenHouse effect. Extreme Volcanism throughout ages has given rise to pressure
                exceeding 100 times that of the Earth and an atmosphere filled with CO2 gas. Besides that, it also
                contains poisonous Sulfuric acid too. As a result, scientists have been forced to look outwards, to
                places like Mars, Titan, Europa and planets outside the solar system in the recent decades.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12">
               <p class="Phosphoine-p-3 p-3-a">
                However, Venus wasn’t ready to give up. The probes sent by us, namely Pioneer and Magellan,
                discovered chemical components based on Sulfur, to be at an excess rate than expected. This
                could be explained via abiotic processes and the extreme volcanism that pervades all over Venus.
                Even keeping that aside, Venus absorbs a larger amount of short wavelength radiation from the
                Sun which makes it look yellow with dark patches that change over time. This could be
                explained by Dust churned up from the Venus’s atmosphere or it could be ‘<id class="VJ">Gigantic</id>’ colonies of
                Microbial life that may well live in the Venusian atmosphere.

             <p class="Phosphoine-p-3 p-4-a">
                It is true that the surface of Venus is absolutely hellish and so is its atmosphere, but around about
                50 kilometers of Altitude we see that it has a pressure and conditions similar to that of the Earth
                but with a trace amount of Sulfuric Acid rain. The probability of life persisting <id class="VJ">(on a micro level)</id>
                was first coined by Carl Sagan. He even hypothesized the possibility of ‘<id class="VJ">Venusian Jellyfish</id>’ in
                that atmospheric zone. However, the idea was a mere fringe at that time and the <id class="VJ">‘Extra-terrestrial
                Hunt’</id> remained outwards.

          <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12">
            <p class="Phosphoine-p-3"> 
                <id class="P-start">In</id> order to determine the existence of life scientists search for something known as ‘<id class="VJ">Bio
                signatures</id>’. These are chemical compounds that are very hard to explain without any living
                activity. We can detect such compounds as the light rays from the planet’s host star passes
                through its atmosphere. Certain absorption lines at precise wavelengths from such ray’s
                spectrograph tell us about its presence. Another similar way is to spectrograph the infra-red
                radiation emitted only by the planet itself. Such a bio-signature detectable at 1.1 mm range is
                Phosphine (PH3). A team of researchers led by Deane Greeves was interested in using Phosphine
                as a possible biosignature for planets outside the solar system. However, they decided to take a
                look at once via the James Clark Maxwell Telescope. To their utmost surprise they found the
                excess existence of Phosphine! Soon after ALMA’s observations followed and it was indeed the
                presence of Phosphine.

             <p class="Phosphoine-p-4">So, although there’s an abundant presence of Phosphine, how does it infer the presence of life? In
                fact, the tetrahedral 3 hydrogen attached to 1 phosphine might be formed easily with a relative
                abundance of Hydrogen and Phosphorus. Scientists have detected its presence in the atmosphere
                of Jupiter and Saturn long ago. However, none screamed the existence of life back then as we
                already knew the exact abiotic process that was fuelling its presence and the relative abundance
                of phosphine decently matched to it. However, in the case of Venus its expected abundance is
                thousands of times more than expected.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12">
             <p class="Phosphoine-p-5">
                Phosphine is a substance that oxidizes itself extremely quickly. In atmospheres like Venus where
                Sulphuric Acid is abundant, Phosphine is soon oxidized to produce oxides as soon as it forms.
                Sure, high pressure and frequent thunderbolts in the Venusian atmosphere might produce
                Phosphine, but its amount is vastly reduced owing to oxidation of PH3. Therefore, we need a
                process to define the excess production of Phosphine that outnumbers its degradation. In fact,
                there is only one known process to produce such a huge amount of it, and that’s the presence of
                Biotic substances. In other words, living organisms.
             </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12">
             <p class="Phosphoine-p-6">So, what would these living creatures look like? In order to answer it, we’ll have to look back to
                the Venusian atmosphere again. Life, if it exists, has to exist in the atmosphere <id class="VJ">(to be precise,
                only within a certain range of the atmosphere)</id> and will have an unthinkable capability to survive
                Sulfuric acid conditions as high as 85 percent concentration. On Earth, we find the most
                surviving organisms to cope with at best 5 percent concentration of Sulfuric acid. Sarah Seager
                from the MIT suggested such a microscopic organism to be <id class="VJ">‘Droplet-Dwelling’</id>. This means the
                microbes on Venus would form droplets out of their own in order to survive such extreme
                conditions. But it poses a problem. The problems would tend to merge with each other and as a
                result, it would soon form heavier droplets. Soon, the droplets would become heavy enough and
                as a result, fall straight through the atmosphere into the hellish grounds. However, in such critical
                situations, the microbes are likely to enter a stage known as <id class="VJ">‘Spore Formation,’</id> such a technique
                is seen in many of the microbes on Earth and it helps them to survive the toughest conditions in
                outer space. Such spore formation techniques will help the Venusian microbes to stay alive even
                in the absence of droplets. When the droplets are shredded off the microbes at a lower altitude,
                the will eventually go up into the habitable zone where it will merge, reproduce, form the droplet
                layer and presumably release an abundance of our cherished Phosphine.</p>

          <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12">
             <p class="Phosphoine-p-7">So, how true is it? First of all, we would need more back up observations and data. Secondly,
                upon further confirmation, scientists may even send satellites to Venus to collect samples of the
                atmosphere and thus, make it possible to confirm its existence. Whatever the results may be, it
                surely has made us think again about our own place within the grand vicinity of the Cosmos.</p>

TASKINUL HUDA SAQUIB




Objective for joining Astroventure  : 

I usually define myself as a man of arts and science. I have a darest fascination for Literature and Physics. I aspire to be an astrophysicist or cosmetologist like Carl Sagan ( Whom I refer to as my icon) and engage in some constructive literary works in my future days. Since my childhood, I have loved to go out, especially at night which indirectly attracted me slowly to the beauty of eternity,beauty of cosmos. Later, I realized that to get to know more about the mysteries of this splendid universe, I have to study Math and Physics. Accordingly, I started practicing simple to complex mathematical problems as well as reading out a dozen books on Astrophysics and Cosmology. I’m still learning the greatest innovations and discoveries in these two fields and hoping to pursue my higher studies in one of these two subjects (Either Math or Astrophysics). I always believe that it’s truly important to get in touch with those people who really think the same as us or dream of us. Since I love Astrophysics and Astroventure is a group of some astro-enthusiasts, so I wish from the core of my heart to be a part of this wonderful team in order to learn more about my favourite aspects, discuss on the complex issues together, work on those and finally prepare ourselves to face the challenges of fulfilling our dreams. I have a lot of plans regarding Astroventure and would like to take this platform to a level so that everyone can recognise us as the forerunners in the revolutionary phase of the practice of Astronomy in Bengal societies.
